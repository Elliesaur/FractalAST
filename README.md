# FractalAST (FAST)
A simple tokenizer, parser and AST generator for s-expressions(ish) and CIL (.NET) Arithmetic OpCodes.

## Supports
- String to FAST,
- .NET CIL to FAST,
- FAST to .NET CIL.

## Why?
- Learning more about how compilers and related areas work.
- Wanting to make an AST, then learning that I needed to construct it somehow. Fell down a rabbit hole.

## Name?
- Eh, cool concept.
