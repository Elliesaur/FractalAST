# FractalAST
A simple tokenizer, parser and AST generator for s-expressions(ish) and CIL (.NET) Arithmetic OpCodes.

## Why?
- Learning more about how compilers and related areas work.
- Wanting to make an AST, then learning that I needed to construct it somehow. Fell down a rabbit hole.


## Name?
- Eh, cool concept.
